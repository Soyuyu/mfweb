      <p>If you want to import code samples, I use the same code
      import mechanism that I use for my prose articles. This means
      you don't have to put code into the xml source itself, instead
      you can extract code from separate files. This allows you to
      have live code files, which can run and be tested. (It also
      avoids awkward escaping issues as the code is imported as a
      CDATA element.)</p>

     <p>The element</p>
      <insertCode file="frags.txt" fragment="basic-insert" />

      <p>The path for code files begins at
      <code>project-dir/code</code>. If you don't name a fragment,
      then the entire file is imported. </p>
      <p>Fragments are defined by starting with a line containing </p>
      <p><code>&lt;codeFragment name = "fragment-name"></code></p>
      <p>and finishing with the line</p>
      <p><code>&lt;/codeFragment></code></p>
      <p>These lines can be placed in comments, allowing you to select
      pretty much any block of code. Code fragment blocks can be nested.</p>
      <p>If you use the attribute <code>useClassName="true"</code>
      then the code importer will try to guess the name of the class
      for the imported code and use it as the label.</p>
