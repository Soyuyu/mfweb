      <p>I should begin by laying out some limitations of the current
      tool-chain</p>
      <ul>
        <li>So far I've only used on a few infodecks done by myself,
        so I haven't put much effort into setting things up to be easy
        for others to get involved.</li>
        <p>In particular this means the creation of infodecks is done
        using tools that I'm comfortable with.</p>
        <li>Since I've only built infodecks for my website so far, the
        toolchain embeds a lot of assumptions about my site into its
        general operation. These need to be teased out, but I feel I
        can best do that only when working with other people's
        decks.</li>
        <p>This includes such simple things as hard-wiring
        my logo onto the slides - but I'm sure there are many
        less-obvious examples.</p>
      </ul>

        <li>To work with the deck you'll need to be comfortable editing
        various forms of web-oriented text documents: XML files for
        content, and CSS (SCSS) for styling. If you're going to play
        with animation behavior you'll need to do some javascript (coffeescript)
        programming.</li>
