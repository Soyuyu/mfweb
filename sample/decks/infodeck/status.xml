      <p>The toolchain currently has many limitations as it's only
      been used by me, and I haven't yet put much energy into making
      it more widely usable.</p>
      <p>Since I've only built infodecks for my website so far, the
      toolchain embeds a lot of assumptions about my site into its
      general operation. These need to be teased out, but I feel I
      can best do that only when working with other people's
      decks. This includes such simple things as hard-wiring
      my logo onto the slides - but I'm sure there are many
      less-obvious examples.</p>

      <p>To work with the deck you'll need to be comfortable editing
      various forms of web-oriented text documents: XML files for
      content, and SCSS for styling. This is enough to write
      infodecks with multiple slides, images, code imports, and some
      simple animations: builds, fades, moving, resizing, and
      travelling highlights. More sophisticated animations and
      customization requires programming in ruby and coffeescript.</p>
      <p>You can import any kind of image, but to get images that size
      well and support manipulation, I use svg images. I draw svg
      images using <a href = "http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, an
      open source image editor. Inkscape is a powerful tool, but has
      the user experience one would expect from an open-source
      tool.</p>
