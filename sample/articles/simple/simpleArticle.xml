is used as the date of the article. There must be at least one version
element and all version elements need a date. -->

Explains how to use this tool-chain for writing simple articles.

  <!-- You can place <p> elements before the first <section> element, but
       once you have a section, all remaining blocks should be inside
       a section. -->
<p>This is an example of a simple article that uses my xml-to-html
toolchain. It acts on two levels, you can read the html to understand
how things are put together, and you can also look at the XML source
to understand how that looks. I have some comments in the XML source
that add some further information about the XML elements that are used.</p>
<section>
<h>Making your own site folder</h>
<p>To make your own site folder there is a script
<code>make-sample.rb</code>. To run it</p>
<pre>
ruby make-sample.rb path/to/target
</pre>
<p>This will create a starting folder in the target directory. You can
then add new articles into the sample directory without worrying about
changes to the core files themselves. You can (and should) make a new
repository for that folder which will be independent of your clone of
mfweb. You should not modify any of the files in mfweb unless you are
experiementing with patching mfweb itself and sending me a pull request.</p>
<p>The link from the sample folder to mfweb is made in the rakefile
with the line <code>MFWEB_DIR = '/path/to/mfweb'</code> at the top of the file.
The default build sets this to the absolute locaiton of the mfweb
folder when you run <code>make-sample</code> so if you move the mfweb
folder later you must update that line. I find it useful to change the
line to <code>MFWEB_DIR = 'mfweb'</code> and symlink the mfweb
directory into the sample folder. You can also make a git submodule
there if you're comfortable with git submodules.</p>
<p>The rakefile in the sample directory controls the build of the articles. There are comments
in the file to explain what various things do if you'd like to tweak
it.</p>

  <h>Simple and Flexible Articles</h>
  <p>The toolchain supports two styles of writing articles, simple and
  flexible. Simple articles have limited code inclusion and packaging
  capabilities, and are best used for articles that don't need to
  connect to a live code base, don't need to be grouped into a
  single folder with their diagrams code etc, and don't need any
  custom handling for transformations or css.</p>
  <p>In this web page, I'll just describe the facilities of the simple
  article, there is <a href = "flexible.html">another web page to
  discuss flexible articles</a>. Simple articles should have their
  source xml file placed in <code>your-folder/articles/simple</code>.
  All xml files found in that folder will be transformed into
  <code>your-folder/build/articles</code>. The only thing that's
  different between a simple article and a flexible article is the way
  the article sources are organized - they both look the same to the
  reader.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h>Overall Structure of an Article</h>
  <p>Simple articles have a top-level element of <code>paper</code>.
  The child elements of paper begin with various header elements,
  followed by the <code>body</code> element that contains the body of
  the article, and finally an optional <code>appendix</code>.</p>
  <section>
    <h>Header Elements</h>
    <p>The example article shows off the various header elements.
    These should be fairly self-explanatory. It's worth highlighting
    that you need at least one <code>version</code> element, as the
    first <code>version</code> sets the date of the article.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h>Body and appendix sections</h>
    <p>The body of the article should include the core content of the
    article. The body can be divided into sections. Each section must
    start with an <code>h</code> element and then 
    block elements. You may have block elements before the first
    section. You may also nest sections within each other.</p>
    <sidebar>
      <p>You can specify sidebars - handy for call outs and links</p>
    </sidebar>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed
    do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
    enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
    nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
    reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
    nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident,
    sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>
    <soundbite>Soundbites are like sidebars, but for the semantics of
    pull quotes. </soundbite>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed
    do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
    enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
    nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
    reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
    nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident,
    sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>
    <p>The appendix can also have sections in the same way as the body.</p>
    </section>

<section>
  <h>Markup elements</h>
<section>
  <h>Basic elements</h>
  <p>The basic elements of an article are mostly copied from HTML.
  Block elements include <code>p</code>, 
  <code>ul</code> and <code>li</code>. Inline
  elements include <code>code</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>b</code>,
  <code>a</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>sup</code>, and
  <code>br</code>.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h>Code listings</h>
  <p>A particularly important feature of the toolchain is its ability
  to import code from live code projects. This allows me to annotate a
  live code project with marker comments and then extract bits of code
  from those code trees into the HTML output. To do this properly, you
  need to use a flexible article, so that you can set up the path of
  the code tree in the build script, but there is some limited support
  for code imports for simple articles.</p>
  <p>The element to use for a code import is <code>insertCode</code>,
  here is an example of it in use.</p>
  <insertCode file="simpleArticle/example.rb" fragment="first"
              label="some code"/>
  <p>A code fragment can have a label to introduce it. You can also
  nest code fragments to pick out smaller parts that have been shown
  in total, such as picking out one line below.</p>
  <insertCode file="simpleArticle/example.rb" fragment="oneLine"/>
  <p>I often use the label atrtribute to indicate the context of a
  code fragment. Usually this context is the name of a class, so there
  is a crude way to get the code importer to derive the class
  name.</p>
   <insertCode file="simpleArticle/example.rb" fragment="second" 
               useClassName="true"/>
  <p> Beware that this mechanism is easily confused if you have nested
  classes in a file.</p>
  <p>The files you need for code fragments in a simple article must
  live in <code>articles/simple/code</code>. I like to then use either
  a file or folder with the same name as the article to help keep code
  fragments apart. This simplificaiton makes code insertions less
  useful for simple articles than for flexible artilces. Indeed you
  don't need code inserts at all, you can just use 
  <code>pre</code> elements directly. One advantage with code inserts
  is that they automatically wrap the inserted code inside
  <code>CDATA</code> nodes which means you don't have to worry about
  escaping XML reserverd  symbols.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h>Tables</h>
  <p>Tables can be specified using the same elements as HTML, which
  are copied over directly to the output. However I usually prefer to
  use semantic markup in these cases.</p>
