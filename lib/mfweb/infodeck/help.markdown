How to use this [Infodeck][]
================

- Tap the question mark in the top banner to show this panel, tap it
  again to hide it. 
- Move forward and backward using the arrow buttons at the top banner.
- If you're on a touch device then a tap on the left or right will
  move backwards or forwards. Tapping elsewhere will bring up a simple
  control panel.
- If this deck has a table of contents, there will be a button on
  the top banner. Tap it to bring up a list of links to some of the
  slides in the deck. Tap it again to hide it.
- You can also use a keyboard:
  -  left-arrow, down-arrow, page-down, and space move forwards. 
  -  right-arrow, up-arrow, page-up, and backspace move backwards
  - If you're on a slide with many builds, then the up and down arrow
    keys will skip over the builds
  - press "g" to bring up a dialog which allows you to jump to any
    slide number. You can also do this by clicking on the page number
    on the banner.
  - press "home" to go to the first slide, "end" to the last
 - press "c" to bring up the table of contents (if there is one). Tap
   c to hide it again.
- The ' # ' in the banner puts a deep link to the currently visible slide
  into the address bar

The deck should work well in the latest versions of most browsers. If
you are using Internet Explorer you will need version 10 to get a
proper experience.
